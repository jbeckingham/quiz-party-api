# quiz-party-api

https://quizparty.netlify.app/

The backend of a multi-player quiz app which lets you ask, answer and mark questions and keep tally of the scores. Named inspired by the video call app "House Party" which was popular when work on this began at the beginning of the pandemic, with the idea being the quiz could be done virtually whilst on a video call.
Written in Node with tests in Jest. Socket.io used to distrubute change in state to all clients.
